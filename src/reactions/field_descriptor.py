The basis of reactions is field change events. These are generated by
a descriptor that implements attribute access. The descriptor is implemented
in this package.

FieldDescriptor is the descriptor implementation. It uses ReactionsList to
track and call the reactions when field values change.

    An instrumented field.
    Generic Types:
        - Ti: the type of class the field is a member of
        - Tf: is the type of object the field references

    This is a descriptor that:
        - manages and tracks updates to the field value
        - provides predicates for comparisons of the field value

    This works by intercepting field accesses on the class to return the
    descriptor itself so that dunder comparison methods on the descriptor can
    create predicates that are wired to instance methods that react to changes.
    The changes are detected by __set__ on instances (rather than their types).

    The general flow is a class with a Field is created. Comparisons are done
    on the class Field attribute to specify predicates with reactions. The
    class is instantiated and values set on the field inspect the predicates
    and call them when the Fields they are composed of change.
